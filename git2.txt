Staging Area (Index):

A temporary storage area where changes are prepared before committing. Files added to the staging area are included in the next commit.
Conflict:

A situation where Git cannot automatically merge changes from different branches. Conflicts occur when changes made to the same part of a file conflict with each other, requiring manual resolution.
Rebase:

Rearranging commits in a branch to appear as if they were made on top of the latest changes in another branch. Rebasing helps maintain a linear project history and integrates changes more cleanly than merging.
